>The problem does not lie in technology but design. I am a true believer in code quality. And I believe clear code and correct design with enough time bring absolute quality to software development.

Let me tell you about myself.

In short, I am a passionate software developer who loves *Java* technologies.

For more details about me, I am a hard-working, innovative software developer with active field experience *since 2009*, mostly specialized in back-end enterprise technologies using *Java* and *Java EE*.

Besides having practical knowledge about solving problems using various *design patterns* and *OOP techniques*, I am highly skilled at *Spring Framework*, Spring Security, ORM frameworks especially JPA, Hibernate and a variety of related technologies.

Also, I’m experienced about *UI/UX technologies* as well for both server-side rendered like JSF, *Vaadin* and client-side rendered like *Javascript*, Jquery, Angular, Aurelia, and Vue.

Certainly, I am a strong follower of *test-driven development*, issue tracking, continuous integration, and source code management.

Among my recent achievements, I have successfully been a lead developer in two startup projects ([ondestek](https://ondestek.com), [kodris](https://www.kodris.com)) and made great contributions to raise them as the profiting and leading companies in Turkey.

Beyond that, I like sharing my experience, mostly about Java and Spring, writing technical articles to contribute, for developing the *open-source community*.

As a personal hobby, I have an interest in *game development* and *gamified concepts* for web applications.
