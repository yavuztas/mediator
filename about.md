Have practical knowledge about solving problems using various design patterns and OOP techniques. I am highly skilled at Spring Framework, Spring Security, ORM frameworks especially JPA, Hibernate and a variety of backend related technologies as well as experienced about UI/UX technologies both server-side rendered like JSF, Vaadin and client-side rendered like Javascript, Jquery and frontend MVC frameworks like Angular, Aurelia.
