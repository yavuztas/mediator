### Stay On-topic
Be sure your topic matches the general idea of the article. For example, all discussions on programming should be related to programming or at least software development.

### No Self-promotion

A discussion or comment that contains only a link to your blog, a product, or your article on another site will always be removed.

### Pick Your Words Wisely

Comments that contain profanity are automatically held for moderator review before being posted. Depending on the context of the comment, it may be removed.

### Do Not Be a Jerk

Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. Sexist, racist, misogynist, homophobic, and broad, offensive generalizations about groups of people are simply not allowed. Comments or discussions written intentionally to provoke will also be removed.

### Just be excellent to each other

My comment policy is simple, just be excellent to each other. That's all :)
