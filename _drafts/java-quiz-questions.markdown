Today I would like to share one of my repositories which is about some interesting java algorithm questions and my solutions to every seven questions implemented beside.

These questions are;
1. Path
2. Folders
3. Sorted Search
4. Palindrome
5. Train Composition
6. Circular Primes
7. Truncatable Primes

You can check the questions and solutions from the repository [java quiz common](https://github.com/yavuztas/java-quiz-common). And feel free to comment if you have something to share. Cheers!
