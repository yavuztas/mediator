I have just created an educational repository aims to provide fundamental information and code samples about **java** and mainly focused on **Spring Framework**. I intent to prepare this repository not only to refresh my knowledge but also for public benefit. So feel free to drop comments about your opinion and any contributions are welcome!

Note that in order to build and run sample codes in this project Java 8 is required.

### Before Start
First of all before we dive into Spring, one should get familiar with some basic programming principals which are highly accepted in Java world and moreover strictly followed in Spring Framework. By this way, I believe this guide will be much more effective and easily understandable. So I will start the first article with [object orient programming and solid principals]({{ site.url }}/java/spring/2019/06/22/object-oriented-programming-and-solid-principles.html) in my next post.
