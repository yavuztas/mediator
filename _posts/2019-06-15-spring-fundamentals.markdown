I have been creating an educational repository that aims to provide fundamental information and code samples about **Java** and mainly focusing on **Spring Framework**. I intend to prepare this repository not only to refresh my knowledge but also for public benefit. So feel free to drop comments about your opinion and any contributions are welcome!

Please note that this guide does not like regular how-to guides explaining every detail from scratch. My goal is to touch every important topic about the core of the Spring Framework instead of writing about specific topics in detail. It is a collection of simple answers to the most common questions about the framework. Thus it might not be for totally beginners or the ones who do not have any experience with Spring Framework before.

You can check the repository over on Github:<br/>

### Before Start
First of all, before we dive into Spring, one should get familiar with some basic programming principles which are highly accepted in Java world and moreover strictly followed in Spring Framework. In this way, I believe this guide will be much more effective and easily understandable. So I will start the first article with *object orient programming and solid principles* in my [next post]({{ site.url }}/java/oop/2019/06/22/object-oriented-programming-and-solid-principles.html).
