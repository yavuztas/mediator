I have just created an educational repository aims to provide fundamental information and code samples about **java** and mainly focused on **Spring Framework**. I intent to prepare this repository not only to refresh my knowledge but also for public benefit. So feel free to drop comments about your opinion and any contributions are welcome!

Please note that this guide does not like regular how to guides explaining every detail from scratch. My goal is to touch every important topic about core of the Spring Framework instead of writing about specific topics in detail. It is a collection of simple answers of most common questions about the framework. Thus it might not be for totally beginners or ones who do not have any experience about Spring Framework before.

Note that in order to build and run sample codes in this project Java 8 is required.

### Before Start
First of all before we dive into Spring, one should get familiar with some basic programming principals which are highly accepted in Java world and moreover strictly followed in Spring Framework. By this way, I believe this guide will be much more effective and easily understandable. So I will start the first article with [object orient programming and solid principals]({{ site.url }}/java/spring/2019/06/22/object-oriented-programming-and-solid-principles.html) in my next post.
