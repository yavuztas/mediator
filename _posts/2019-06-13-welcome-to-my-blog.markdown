This is a momentous occasion for me, so many years I had to wait to launch my own personal blog. Under the burden of my daily work I thought I cannot share my experiences because I am a so busy software developer who has great passion on java and related technologies. Man I was wrong!

We, the developers especially the lazy ones like me :) always tend to cope out quickly when it comes to writing articles or anything like documents. Although it does not need to be fancy, most of the time it makes me feel like harder than coding.

But believe me, the trick is a good time management and a little bit self-discipline nothing more. And we, the developers owe so much things to share!

From now on, I am writing...

{% highlight java %}
public class MyBlogApplicationStarter {

    public static void main(String args[]){

        MyBlog myBlog = MyBlogFactory.create("{{ site.url }}");
        myBlog.start();

    }

}
{% endhighlight %}
