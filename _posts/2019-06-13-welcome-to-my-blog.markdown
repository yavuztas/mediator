A momentous occasion for me, so many years passed until I launched my own blog. Under the burden of my daily work, I thought I couldn't share my experience because I was a fairly busy guy. Man, I was wrong!

Developers — especially the lazy ones like me — always tend to cop out quickly when it comes to writing, simply anything than code. Even though the output doesn't have to be perfect, it feels way harder than coding most of the time.

But believe me, the trick is a bit of time management and self-discipline, nothing more. We, developers, owe so many things to the public community. And we, developers, have so much to share.

From now on, I'm writing.

{% highlight java %}
public class MyBlogApplicationStarter {

    public static void main(String args[]){

        MyBlog myBlog = MyBlogFactory.create("{{ site.url }}");
        myBlog.start();

    }

}
{% endhighlight %}
